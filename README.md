# Solving-SIR-Model
Included is a Jupyter file which solves the SIR Model equations, in an attempt to model the spread of COVID over a population.

The main file is the HTML file, however it formats pretty questionably on the github repository. I have included the Jupyter lab file for a clearer picture.

This file was formed as part of a continuous assessment in Computational Physics during my third year of university at Cardiff University.

This file solves the SIR Model equations using well described functions including references where applicable. It also models the amount of people that
require vaccination to stop the outbreak from being extremely serious. A vaccination rate of around 20-30% was found to keep the hospitals not
overloaded. 

This model depends upon a few things which are unconfirmed about COVID, mainly that people that get it develop an immunity. This has not been proven. 
Furthermore, this model does not adjust transmission rate based on face mask usage or lockdowns, it merely takes in an initial infected population
and transmission rate which remains unchanged through the model.
